# Hi — I'm Alexander (Alex) Asomba 👋

I'm a software engineer who turns ideas into reliable, maintainable products that people love to use. I focus on building practical systems and developer tools that accelerate teams and make complex things simple.

- 🔭 I build backend services, APIs, and developer tooling
- 🌱 I enjoy learning distributed systems, observability, and developer experience
- 💬 Ask me about: building resilient systems, API design, mentoring engineers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love turning messy problems into clear, working solutions

---

## What I do — in plain English
I help teams ship faster by building clean, well-tested systems and developer-focused tools. I take ownership of problems from discovery through production and care about developer ergonomics, reliability, and long-term maintainability.

Core strengths:
- APIs & backend architecture
- Observability, monitoring & reliability
- Developer tooling & internal platforms
- Clean, testable code and code reviews

## Selected projects
Below are a few highlights — click to explore. (Replace with your real projects and links.)

- Project A — short 1-line outcome: what it does and a measurable win (e.g., reduced latencies by X%)
  - Link: PROJECT_LINK_1
- Project B — short 1-line outcome: built the API and deployment pipeline
  - Link: PROJECT_LINK_2
- Open-source / Tooling — short 1-line: small library or tool you maintain
  - Link: PROJECT_LINK_3

If you want, give me the three projects you want highlighted and I’ll turn them into polished bullets like the above.

## How I work
- Empathy-first collaboration: I listen, propose pragmatic solutions, and iterate fast.
- Documented decisions: I prefer small, reversible changes and clear docs so teams move faster.
- Measurement-driven: I instrument systems and watch outcomes so we can improve continuously.

---

## I’m open to
- Collaboration on backend systems, APIs, and platform tooling
- Contract or full-time roles where I can help teams ship better software
- Mentoring engineers and pairing on architecture and code quality
